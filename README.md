# 4 Fermion Interaction (4FI)

This repository holds all the information that served for the construction of the 4FI project. In here We study the contribution of the torsion-descendent four-fermion contact interaction to the decay width of a neutral (pseudo)scalar field into a fermion pair. This new interaction comes from the existence of gravitational torsion in models with extra dimensions. Additionally, we exemplify the formalism by studying two cases: first, the variation of the considered branching ratio of the Higgs in the context of the Standard Model, and second the proper variations of the scalar and pseudoscalar fields of the type II-1 two-Higgs doublets model.
## Paper published ##

This project led to the publication of the article called "[Correction to (pseudo) scalar decay into a fermion pair from gravitational torsion](https://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/index_n.php?I=R&V=49&N=1#41)", which was published in: A Phys Pol. B.49.41 (2018)
